This was the fourth lab assignment for CS1. It covers RSA encryption, one of the oldest widely used for secure data transmission.
# To run:
encrypt.py will convert ciphertext2.txt to encrypted text.
crypto.py converts ciphertext1.txt and ciphertext2.txt to their decrypted versions and saves them as files in the directory.
